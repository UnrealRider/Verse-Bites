## üìñ About

**Verse-Bites** is an open-source learning and utility project for UEFN Verse. We don't aim for deep theory or comprehensive official documentation, but focus on providing **quick-start, out-of-the-box** learning snippets and code modules.

The project is centered around `Verse-Bites` and extends into three main auxiliary modules: `Lesson-Bites` courses designed for beginners, standardized `Pattern-Bites` code patterns, and plug-and-play `Game-Bites` game features.

### Core Philosophy

  - **üéØ Minimalism**: Providing only "what you need to know now," avoiding lengthy explanations.
  - **üõ†Ô∏è Practicality First**: Get hands-on first, then dive deeper. We encourage learning by directly **copying**, **pasting**, and **modifying** examples.
  - **üìö Your Quick Reference**: When you run into problems, use **Verse-Bites** as your "Verse dictionary" for quick lookups.

## üß© Core Modules

The entire open-source content system is divided into four main parts:

### üìö Lesson-Bites

**Focus**: Beginner (L1 - L35) and intermediate (L36 - L55+) courses designed for creators with zero coding background.

**Features**: This is the best starting point for your Verse journey. You don't need to grasp everything at once; follow the pace of the lessons and understand how Verse works through hands-on practice.

**Start Learning**: [Start your journey here](https://github.com/UnrealRider/Verse-Bites/blob/main/Lesson-Bites/README.md)

> **Please Note**: This course is experimental and may use non-traditional methods aimed at rapid onboarding. Experienced developers might find its approach different from conventional programming tutorials.

### üí° Verse-Bites (Coming Soon)

**Focus**: Quick reference points for Verse syntax, development tips, and best practices.

**Content**: Includes short tips, common bug fixes, efficient code snippets, and more‚Äîyour daily development "cheatsheet".

### üì¶ Pattern-Bites (In Preparation)

**Focus**: Standardized, reusable, and fully open-source foundational code patterns.

**Content**: Includes modules for persistent data, player management, UI frameworks, utilities, and more to help you build a solid project foundation.

### üéÆ Game-Bites (In Planning)

**Focus**: Plug-and-play mini-game feature modules.

**Content**: Provides fun features like a prize wheel, animation controllers, etc., to quickly add highlights to your project.
