## About Verse-Bites

**Verse-Bites** is an open-source resource hub for learning and applying the Verse programming language, designed especially for creators with *zero* prior coding experience.  
This project takes a non-traditional, hands-on approach—focused on quick, minimal learning bites, rather than in-depth theory or comprehensive documentation.

### Philosophy

- **Minimalism:** Lessons are ultra-short and laser-focused on “just what you need to know”—no lengthy explanations or deep dives.
- **Practicality:** Don’t worry about mastering everything up front. Learn just enough to get started, then copy/paste and tweak real examples as you go.
- **Reference First:** When you get stuck or hit something unfamiliar, treat Verse-Bites as your “Verse dictionary.”

## Module Structure

Verse-Bites resources are organized into four main sections:

- **Verse-Bites** — Essential beginner content and syntax basics.
- **Quick-Bites** — Short tips, best practices, and common bug fixes.
- **Game-Bites** — Ready-to-use gameplay modules (e.g. Lucky Wheel, simple systems).
- **Pattern-Bites** — Standardized, reusable code snippets for your own projects.
