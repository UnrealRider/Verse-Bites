   * Create functions that return a result using the `return` keyword.

* #### **Lesson 20 – Option**:
   * Learn the `option` type to safely handle values that might not exist.

* #### **Lesson 21 – Array (1)**:
   * Learn how to create and access elements in an `array`.

* #### **Lesson 22 – For and Range**:
   * Use `for` loops and `range` to iterate through arrays and perform repetitive tasks.

* #### **Lesson 23 – Array (2) - Adding and Modifying Arrays**:
   * Learn to add (`+=`) and modify (`set Array[Index] = ...`) elements in an array.

* #### **Lesson 24 – Array (3) - Finding, Removing, and More Tools**:
   * Master built-in array tools for finding, removing, and replacing elements.

* #### **Lesson 25 – Map (1) - The Key-Value Dictionary**:
   * Learn about the `map`, a key-value pair data structure.

* #### **Lesson 26 – Map (2) - Adding, Modifying, and Removing**:
   * Learn how to add, modify, and remove elements from a `map`.

* #### **Lesson 27 – Scope Supplement (1) - The Lifetime of Variables**:
   * Deepen your understanding of scope with the concept of variable "lifetime".

* #### **Lesson 28 – Tuple (1)**:
   * Learn to use `tuple` to package multiple different data types together.

* #### **Lesson 29 – Tuple (2)**:
   * Learn advanced uses of `tuple` combined with arrays and functions.

* #### **Lesson 30 – suspends, spawn & Sleep**:
   * Learn asynchronous programming and concurrent tasks with `<suspends>`, `spawn`, and `Sleep`.

* #### **Lesson 31 – loop & break & return**:
   * Create infinite loops with `loop` and control them with `break` and `return`.

* #### **Lesson 32 – Enum**:
   * Use `enum` to create named constants, replacing "magic numbers" for better code readability and safety.

* #### **Lesson 33 – Player & Message**:
   * Differentiate between `agent` and `player`, and use the `message` type to interact with UI devices.

* #### **Lesson 34 – Class(1): Building a Timer Robot**:
   * Learn the basics of `class`, including custom classes, inheritance, and instantiation.

* #### **Lesson 35 – Class(2): Mass Production and Automation of Robots**:
   * Learn about mass production and automation of objects using classes to achieve a "separation of concerns" design pattern.

* #### **Lesson 36 – Class(3): Building Device Systems and Communication**:
   * Build device systems and establish one-way communication between devices (e.g., a central hub model).

* #### **Lesson 37 – Class(4) Event & Await : The Ultimate Communication Solution Between Devices**:
   * Implement two-way communication between devices using the `event` and `Await` system.

* #### **Lesson 38 – Struct**:
   * Learn to use `struct` to create pure data containers.

* #### **Lesson 39 – Common Issues**:
