### UEFN Verse: Foundational Course

#### Lessons 00 - 19 üß™ (Public Beta)
* #### Lesson 00 ‚Äì Before You Start Learning
    * Preparation of the environment and files before learning.

* #### Lesson 01 ‚Äì Creating Your First Verse Device
    * Learn to create a basic `creative_device` and use the `Print` function to display text in the game.

* #### Lesson 02 ‚Äì Making a Device "Talk" to a Button
    * Learn how to use `@editable` to link a Verse device with a button in UEFN.

* #### Lesson 03 ‚Äì Comments
    * Learn how to add single-line comments (`#`) and block comments (`<# #>`) in your code.

* #### Lesson 04 ‚Äì Creating Fields (Constants and Variables)
    * Learn how to define immutable "constants" and "variables" that can be modified with `set`.

* #### Lesson Template ‚Äì Create a General Testing Template in MyBites.verse
    * Prepare a general testing template with multiple buttons for subsequent lessons.

* #### Lesson 05 ‚Äì Common Type: string
    * Learn how to use the `string` type to handle text and display it in combination with other fields.

* #### Lesson 06 ‚Äì Common Types: int, float & Math Operations
    * Get to know integers (`int`) and floating-point numbers (`float`), and learn basic math operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

* #### Lesson 07 ‚Äì Advanced Fields: Field & @editable
    * Learn how to use `@editable` to expose fields like numbers or text to the UEFN editor for direct adjustment.

* #### Lesson 08 ‚Äì Control Flow: Making Decisions with if
    * Learn to use `if`, `else if`, and `else` statements to execute different logic based on different conditions.

* #### Lesson 09 ‚Äì Making More Precise Decisions: Comparison Operators
    * Learn to use comparison operators like `>` (greater than), `<` (less than), `=` (equal to), and `<>` (not equal to).

* #### Lesson 10 ‚Äì Compound Conditions: or & and
    * Learn how to combine multiple conditions using `or` and `and` to implement more complex logic.

* #### Lesson 11 ‚Äì Core Concept of Verse: Failable Expressions
    * Understand the core concept that "failure" does not equal "error" in Verse, and how `if` statements handle success and failure.

* #### Lesson 12 ‚Äì Data Type Conversion: int, float & string
    * Learn how to convert between basic data types like `int`, `float`, and `string`.

* #### Lesson 13 ‚Äì Common Type: logic
    * Learn to use the `logic` type (`true`/`false`) to represent on/off switches or states.

* #### Lesson 14 ‚Äì Query & not
    * Learn to use the `?` and `not` keywords to write cleaner and more professional `logic` type conditions.

* #### Lesson 15 ‚Äì Scope
    * Understand the concept of "scope" for variables and functions in code, i.e., the contexts in which they are visible and usable.

* #### Lesson 16 ‚Äì Functions (1) The Building Blocks of Code
    * A formal introduction to defining and calling a simple function, encapsulating code into reusable modules.

* #### Lesson 17 ‚Äì Functions (2) 
    * Learn to create a function that can modify existing variables.

* #### Lesson 18 ‚Äì Functions (3) Parameters
    * Learn how to create "parameters" for functions to make them more flexible and versatile.

* #### Lesson 19 ‚Äì Functions (4) Return
    * Learn how to create a function with a "return value" that provides a result after its execution.

#### Lessons 20 - 35 üì¶ (Completed - Awaiting Release)
* #### Lesson 20 ‚Äì Block | Placeholder
    * Understand the use of the `block` expression, primarily as a temporary code placeholder in functions or control flows.

* #### Lesson 21 ‚Äì Option | Optional Values
    * Learn how to handle a special type of variable that may "have a value" or "have no value."

* #### Lesson 22 ‚Äì API & Device Interaction
    * Learn how to use UEFN's built-in devices and call their functions, as well as how to view the Verse API files to discover more functionalities.

* #### Lesson 23 ‚Äì Array (1) Creation & Access
    * Learn how to create arrays, access and modify specific elements by index, and get the array's length.

* #### Lesson 24 ‚Äì For | Looping
    * Learn to use the `for` loop to iterate over a range or all elements of an array.

* #### Lesson 25 ‚Äì Array (2) Dynamic Modification
    * Learn how to dynamically add one or more new elements to an existing array.

* #### Lesson 26 ‚Äì Array (3) Removing Elements
    * Learn the common method for removing an element from an array: by creating a new array that excludes the element.

* #### Lesson 27 ‚Äì Map (1) Key-Value Pairs
    * Get to know the `map` data structure, learning how to store and access a "Value" using its corresponding "Key."

* #### Lesson 28 ‚Äì Map (2) Add, Remove, Modify
    * Learn how to add new key-value pairs to a `map`, modify existing values, and remove specified pairs.

* #### Lesson 29 ‚Äì Tuple (1) Compound Data
    * Learn the basics of the `tuple`, a structure that can group a fixed collection of different data types.

* #### Lesson 30 ‚Äì Tuple (2) Tuple as a Parameter
    * Learn how to pass an entire `tuple` as a parameter to a function for convenient handling of structured data.

* #### Lesson 31 ‚Äì Tuple (3) Function Return
    * Learn how to make a function return a `tuple`, allowing it to pass back multiple results of different types at once.

* #### Lesson 32 ‚Äì suspends Keyword & spawn
  
* #### Lesson 33 ‚Äì Sleep
  
* #### Lesson 34 ‚Äì loop, return & break
  
* #### Lesson 35 ‚Äì Class
